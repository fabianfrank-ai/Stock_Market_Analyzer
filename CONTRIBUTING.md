# 🚀 Contributing

Hey there! Thanks for checking out the project 😄  
This started as a personal experiment, but I’d love for others to join in and help make it better!

## How You Can Help ✨

- **🐞 Report Issues:** Found a bug or something weird? Open an issue with a description and steps to reproduce.  
- **💡 Suggest Features:** Got a cool idea? Add it as an issue or comment on an existing one.  
- **🛠️ Submit Pull Requests:** Fork the repo, make your changes in a branch, and open a pull request. Tell us what you changed and why—it helps a lot!

## Coding Guidelines 📜

- Keep your code **readable and organized**.  (unlike me)
- Use **descriptive names** for variables and functions.  
- Add **comments or docstrings** if it’s not obvious what your code does.  
- Follow consistent formatting (PEP 8 for Python).

## Communication 🤝

- Be **friendly and respectful**.  
- Questions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome. Don’t be shy!  

Thanks for contributing and helping this project grow! 🌱
